# Robotic Wheels Assembly with TT Motors

## Overview
This project focuses solely on the mechanical **assembly** of robotic wheels with TT motors.  
All components were pre-designed, and the main task was to correctly assemble them into a functional and aligned system.

## Assembly Purpose
The objective of this assembly is to understand:
- How TT motors integrate with robotic wheels.
- Proper alignment between motor shafts and wheels.
- Basic mechanical assembly principles used in small robotic systems.

## Assembly Scope
- No part modeling was performed.
- Work was limited to assembling existing components.
- Focus on correct positioning, orientation, and mechanical fit.
